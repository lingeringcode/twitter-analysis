# Twitter analysis tools in python

A repo for some of my twitter data analysis/viz scripts/work.

## dup-rm.py

This script removes duplicate entries.

## keyword_csv.py

This is a commandline tool to extract tweets that mention the provided keyword from a json file, which then provides a csv file as output with the time of the tweet and the tweet itself.

## wordcount.py

This is script that tallies up how many times a word is used within a corpus of tweets. It then creates a simple CSV file with both the word and its respective count. Here is a website using data created from this script: http://rsa14cloud.clindgrencv.com/

## rsa_kw_race.ipynb

Example ipython notebook entry, utilizing the keyword csv output.
